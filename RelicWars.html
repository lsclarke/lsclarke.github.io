        <h1>Relic Wars</h1>

        <h2>Relic Wars is a 3D Sci- Fi Fantasy game created in Unreal Engine 5. Your job is to infiltrate the enemy camp and defeat all the enemy's and climb the tower. 
            In a team of 6, I was the gameplay programmer for this game. I worked on the player parkour movements and climbing mechanics, 
            and the player character model for the game. Everyone who has worked on the project can be found in the credit menu.
